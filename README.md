# About Me
For years, I have been interested in programming and software development. My journey began early in high school, when I found an affinity for problem solving. The logic and puzzles behind software were of great interest to me. By the middle of my high school career, I was hooked, and had decided to enroll at my local career center. This choice changed my trajectory from then on.
